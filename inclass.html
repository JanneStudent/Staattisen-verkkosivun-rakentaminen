      <blockquote> <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combe_Hill,_East_Sussex">Hill is a causewayed enclosure,[2] a form of earthwork that was built in northwestern Europe, including the southern British Isles, in the early Neolithic.[3][4] Causewayed enclosures are areas that are fully or partially enclosed by ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground, often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.[5] The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate.[6] The causeways are difficult to explain in military terms since they would have provided multiple ways for attackers to pass through the ditches to the inside of the camp, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force.[7][8] Evidence of attacks on some sites support the idea that the enclosures were built as fortified settlements.[6][note 1] They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery. There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains was deliberately deposited in the ditches.[9] The construction of these enclosures took only a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.[10]

        Over seventy causewayed enclosures have been identified in the British Isles,[6] and they are one of the most common types of early Neolithic site in western Europe. About a thousand are known in all.[11] They began to appear at different times in different parts of Europe: dates range from before 4000 BC in northern France, to shortly before 3000 BC in northern Germany, Denmark, and Poland.[5] The enclosures in southern Britain began to appear shortly before 3700 BC, and continued to be built for at least 200 years; in a few cases, they continued to be used as late as 3300 to 3200 BC.[3][4]

        Plan of Combe Hill enclosure showing location of excavations. Musson's trenches in 1949 are in yellow, labelled 1 and 2, and Seton-Williams' trenches in 1962 are in blue, labelled A through G.
        Combe Hill is on the South Downs, overlooking the Weald to the north, about five kilometres (three miles) northwest of Eastbourne, in East Sussex.[12][13] An inner circuit of ditch and bank is almost complete, except for where it meets a steep downslope on the north side. The remains of an outer circuit of ditch and bank are visible to the west and east, enclosing an area of about 1.7 ha (4.2 acres),[13] with the inner circuit covering 0.6 ha (1.5 acres).[14] A round barrow lies about 100 m (110 yd) to the west, and two more are within 150 m (160 yd) to the east, along the same hilltop; one is possibly of Anglo-Saxon origin.[13] The enclosure is crossed by a footpath, from Jevington northeastwards to Willingdon.[12] Two of the causeways, at the south and east, are wider than the others, and may have originally been entranceways.[13]
        
        Only one radiocarbon date has been obtained from the site; it was taken from charcoal from the ditch at the south end of trench 1 in the plan at right, and indicates the site was constructed no later than the second half of the fourth millennium BC.[13][12] The secondary (outer) circuit may indicate two stages of use, but the two excavations found little deposited material, and it may be that the site did not see extensive use.[13] The great majority of pottery finds came from the western side, and are associated with animal bone and charcoal fragments; Peter Drewett, who reviewed the excavation history in 1994, suggested that three polished axes deposited at the eastern side of the enclosure were there to mark a boundary, for example if the enclosure represented the eastern extent of the territorial control of the people who built it.[15]
